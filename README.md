# **Big Sales Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor**

## **Overview**
This project was developed as part of my final year internship with the YBI Foundation. Over the course of one month, I focused on predicting big sales using a Random Forest Regressor model. The primary objective was to analyze sales data and identify key factors influencing sales performance.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to predict future sales based on historical data. By leveraging the Random Forest Regressor, we aim to understand the patterns and factors that drive sales, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is provided by the YBI Foundation. It includes various features such as:
- **Item_Identifier**
- **Item_Weight**
- **Item_Fat_Content**
- **Item_Visibility**
- **Item_Type**
- **Item_MRP**
- **Outlet_Identifier**
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**
- **Outlet_Size**
- **Outlet_Location_Type**
- **Outlet_Type**
- **Item_Outlet_Sales**

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating relevant features that influence sales.
3. **Model Training**: Using the Random Forest Regressor to train the model on the dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared score.

## Results
The Random Forest Regressor model achieved an R-squared score of approximately 0.54, indicating moderate predictive performance. This model helps in understanding the factors affecting sales and predicting future sales trends.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to sales prediction using machine learning. The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses optimize their sales strategies and improve overall performance.
